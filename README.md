## üöÄ Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate Google's Gemini AI API into a Node.js application using Express.js. It serves as a foundational template for building AI-driven applications, such as chatbots, content generators, or smart assistants.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **Express.js Backend**: A lightweight and flexible Node.js framework for building web applications.
- **Gemini AI Integration**: Seamless connection to Google's Gemini AI API for advanced AI capabilities.
- **Environment Configuration**: Utilizes `.env` files for secure and manageable environment variables.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable structure to add more AI functionalities or endpoints.

## üì¶ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/litha-octa/Implementing-Gemini-AI-using-Express.git
cd Implementing-Gemini-AI-using-Express

### 2. Install Depedencies
npm install

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

## Security Notice

Ensure that your .env file is added to .gitignore to prevent sensitive information from being committed to version control:
# .gitignore
.env

### Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the Gemini AI through the defined endpoints.
Example with curl:

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/query \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "prompt": "What is the capital of France?"
}'
